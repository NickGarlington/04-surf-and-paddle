          <h3>On Monday Feb 22nd</h3>

        <div class="peyton-p">
          Everyone assumed that Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning
          would ride into the sunset after a victory in Super Bowl 50.
          But not everyone grasps how much Peyton Manning loves playing football.
          Not only has Manning not announced his retirement, but there have been
          recent reports that he’s telling people close to him he still enjoys playing.
          And when he delivered a speech in Florida on Wednesday night, he sounded like
          a man who wants to keep playing.
        </div>
        <div class="peyton-p2">
          That’s the word from Jeff Darlington of NFL Media, who
          attended the speech last night and appeared this morning on
          PFT Live. Darlington said Manning didn’t specifically say whether
          he’s going to keep playing or not, but he sounded like a man who’s
          not ready to retire.“He did talk in present tense when he’s talking
          about his career,” Darlington said. “He sounds like a guy who still
          wants to play. He does not sound like a guy who is a week away from
          retirement.”
